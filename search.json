The slow web sucks.\n\nThe Web has gotten to be bloated. We download so much crap\nevery time we visit a new web page. Of course, we can hack around and\nengineers can try to get you to download more data just before you need\nit. We just are making things more difficult.\n\n\n\nCreating a Faster Webpage Makes Google Happy\n\nGoogle is always thinking about performance. They focus on their users\nand it&rsquo;s a success when a user performs these three simple steps.\n\n\nGoes to the Search Page\nFinds a result above the Page Fold\nClick the link and never return\n\n\nThey are looking to get you your results as fast as\npossible and send you to the most relevant page. Where as other\ncompanies like Facebook are looking to keep you on the website as long\nas possible.\n\nGoogle not only wants to perform well but they are thinking about the\nuser experience through and through. So they favor pages that also\nperform well in their algorithms.\n\nWhen you are on the go, latency is critical for downloading all these\nassets. Of course we do not have the same internet speeds as\nour desktops. Majority of the time on our phones, we are consuming\ncontent like a magazine. So what is Google going to do?\n\n\n\nSpeeding up the Mobile Web with AMP\n\nGoogle has open sourced Accelerated Mobile pages (AMP)\nalong with these companies. Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin and others. For every web page you\nown, you create another version of your page using the AMP framework.\n\nAMP is a strict framework designed to make fast web pages that is\nperfect for mobile web browsing. You can not even load your custom\nJavaScript, only predefined components. So it is designed for the\nend user to consume content. You also can&rsquo;t use any forms either.\n\nWhere is AMP used on the web?\n\nAMP was released in February 2016. You will see the AMP pages in\naction when you search on your phone any kind of news article. In the\nscreen shot below, check out the cool looking AMP logo right under the\narticles. You can then swipe to browse the articles in the\nsearch results\n\nTo provide data to google, you&rsquo;ll have to combine technology AMP with\nJSON+LD. (Which i&rsquo;ll go over in a future essay)\n\n\n\nWhen you open up an AMP page, you will notice that the page loads\nimmediately. It performs so well that you can swipe from page to\npage and it feels like nothing is loading.\n\n\n\nSo how will this grow my business?\n\nI think in the future. Google will start to favor reputable AMP pages in their\nsearch results vs a non-AMP page. Companies are more likely to adopt AMP because\nit is open sourced. This is in competition with Facebook&rsquo;s Instant Articles and Apple News.\n"},{"id":1,"title":"Talking about Growth","url":"/talking-about-growth/","content":"You know the feeling when you create something awesome and you\nhave spent countless days and nights working on it.\nYou tell your friends and family about your new creative and they love it.\nYou release it on the internet and sit and waiting for customers.\n\n&ndash; So now what?\n\nJust as important as building the product, it is just as important to\ngrow the product. The 2 subjects are 2 sides of the same coin to achieve\na common goal.\n\nWho am I?\n\nMy name is Eric Raio, pronounced (Ray-oh) :D\n\nI am a former Sr. Software Engineer from Sony working on the PlayStation Network.\nBefore I was an Engineer at Bandsintown implementing\ngrowth hacks that contributed to growing the product from 250K Users to 7 Million\nand congrats to the team getting to 23 Million to date!\n\nI have built many products where I grew them on my own to thousands of users.\nNailing those hockey stick growth spikes is addicting to me and I am writing on here to write my experiences.\n\nThis Blog\n\nI created this blog from scratch because this blog is also a product that I will experiment on\nand write about my findings. The goal is to grow my newsletter subscription list\nso that is my single metric that I will be focusing on.\n\nBreaking the Convention\n\nSome of the tactics that I share is not what people are used to doing\nand that&rsquo;s why it works well for me. Now that I left my job at Sony, I\nplan on building my own products.\n\nExperiment with new &ldquo;Growth Hacks&rdquo; (not a big fan of that term but it&rsquo;s true)\nthat I uncover from an engineering perspective. I am writing these\nessays for engineers who want to market or marketers who want to get technical.\n\nI will break them down into step by step how to guides.\n"}]
