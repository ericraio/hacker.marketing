**How often do you experience slow internet?** *Do you want to throw
your phone when you have poor cell service?*
*Do you curse at your TV when your favorite video game starts to lag?*

-- Let's face it. The slow web sucks.

The Web has gotten to be very bloated. We download so much crap
every time we visit a new webpage. Of course, we can hack around and
engineers can try to get you to download more data just before you need
it.

## Creating a Faster Webpage Makes Google Happy

Google is always thinking about performance. They focus on their users
and it's a success when a user performs these three simple steps.

- Goes to the Search Page
- Finds a result above the Page Fold
- Click the link and never return

They are looking to get you your results as fast as
possible and send you to the most relevent page. Where as other
companies like Facebook are looking to keep you on the website as long
as possible.

Google not only wants to perform well but they are thinking about the
user experience through and through. So they favor pages that also
perform well in their algorithms.

When you are on the go, latency is critical for downloading all these
assets and of course we simply don't have the same internet speeds as
our desktops. Majority of the time on our phones, we are consuming
content like a magazine. So what is Google going to do?

## Speeding up the Mobile Web with AMP

Google has open sourced <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Accelerated Mobile pages</a> (AMP)
with partnerships from Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin and others. For every web page you
own, you create another version of your page using the AMP framework.

AMP is a strict framework designed to make very fast web pages that is
perfect for mobile web browsing. You can not even load your custom
JavaScript, only pre-defined components. So it is designed for the end user to consume content
quickly. You also can't use any forms either.

## Where is AMP used on the web?

Since this was released in February 2016, you'll see the AMP pages in
action when you search on your phone any kind of news article. In the
screenshot below, check out the cool looking AMP logo right under the
articles. You can then swipe to quickly browse the articles in the
search results.

In order to provide data to google, you'll have to combine technology AMP with
JSON+LD. (Which i'll go over in a future essay)

When you open up an AMP page, you will notice that the page loads very
quickly. It loads so quickly that you can swipe from page to page and
they are loading instantly.

## So how will this grow my business?

In theory, Google will start to favor reputable AMP pages in their
search results vs a non-AMP page. AMP being open source will also prove
to provide more value in the long run as new features will be built
around these new pages. This is in competition with
Facebook's Instant Articles and Apple News.
