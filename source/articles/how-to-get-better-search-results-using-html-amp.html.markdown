**How often do you experience slow internet?** *Do you want to throw
your phone when you have poor cell service?*
*Do you curse at your TV when your favorite video game starts to lag?*

-- Let's face it. The slow web sucks.

The Web has gotten to be very bloated. We download so much crap
everytime we view a new page. Of course, we can hack around and us
engineers can try to get you to download more crap when you don't need it just yet.

## Creating a Faster Webpage Makes Google Happy

Google is always thinking about performance. They focus on their users
and it's a success when a user performs these three simple steps.

- Goes to the Search Page
- Finds a result above the Page Fold
- Click the link and never returns

They are looking to get you your results as fast as
possible and send you to the most relevent page. Where as other
companies like Facebook are looking to keep you on the website as long
as possible.

Google not only wants to perform well but they are thinking about the
user experience through and through. So they favor pages that also
perform well in their algorithms.

When you are on the go, latency is critical for downloading all these
assets and of course we simple don't have the same internet speeds as
our desktops. Yet on our phones, majority of the time we are consuming
content like a magazine. So what is Google going to do?
