You know the feeling when you create something totally awesome and you
have spent countless days and nights working on it. You tell your friends and family about your new creative and they love it.
You release it on the internet and sit and waiting for customers.

-- So now what?

Just as important as building the product, it's just as important to
grow the product. The 2 subjects are 2 sides of the same coin to achieve
a common goal.

### Who am I?
My name is Eric Raio, pronounced (Ray-oh) :D

I am a former Sr. Software Engineer from Sony working on the PlayStation
Network. Prior to this, I was an Engineer at Bandsintown implementing
growth hacks that contributed to growing the product from 250K Users to
7Million and congrats to the team getting to 23Million to date!

I have built numerous of products where I grew them on my own to thousands of users.
Nailing those hockey stick growth spikes is addicting to me and I am writing on here to write my experiences.

### This Blog
I created this blog from scratch because this blog is also a product
that I will thoroughly experiment on and write about my findings. The goal is to grow my newsletter
subscription list so that is my single metric that I will be focusing
on.

### Breaking the Convention
Some of the tactics that I share is not what people are used to doing
and that's why it works well for me. Now that I left my job at Sony, I
plan on building my own products. Experiment with new "Growth Hacks" *(not a big fan of that term but it's true)*
that I uncover from an engineering perspective. I am writing these
articles for engineers who want to market or marketers to get technical.
I will break them down into step by step how to guides.
